/*  
MVP
What I first need to do is to create an initial page which introduces the user that this is trivia. this page will have a button which allows the user to access the trivia with random questions.

On this second page will be random questions from the trivia API. I will have 10 questions from a selected category. These 10 questions will have multiple answer choices. If it is picked right and submitted - you will get a notifcation saying you are right. If you did not select the right answer, it will tell you which one is the right answer. This should happen 10 times.
After the 10th question, there will be a score screen. On this score screen will have the #/10 questions you got right. There will also be a button that should take you to the first screen. After taking you to the first screen, the 10 questions should refresh into a random new category with random questions.
